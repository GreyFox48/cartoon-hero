		<p>Genn Greymane is the King of the Gilnean people, many of which are afflicted by the "Worgen Curse".  
		Having lost his kingdom to unprovoked aggression from the Horde, he joined the Alliance to ensure his people's future prosperity.  Recently, however, the refuge for his people was attacked and destroyed again in the Burning of Teldrassil, and now his leadership will be needed to guide both Anduin Wryn, the Alliance's newfound king, and  his remaining people.</p>
